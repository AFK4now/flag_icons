# International Standards (Flags) Graphics
The zip file contains flags of the world graphics for 201 countries. The graphic sizes are arranged in multiple sizes for iOS app development: 

- 200px x 100px - @1x
- 400px x 200px - @2x
- 600px x 300px - @3x 

The @1x graphics do not have filename extensions; instead their filenames are just the name of the country they represent. The two larger sized files have names appended with '@2x' and '@3x' accordingly. 

It was a quick hack, so there are elongations and imperfections, but these will work in a pinch so you can take your time to create better graphics... 

Enjoy,
